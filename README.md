# Description

This project aims to simulate concepts related to **bitcoin mining** and its notion of **proof of work**
but also **attack strategies** in which our interest is to visualize the critical levels of **profitability** 
and the **hash power** needed to achieve it.

The results are from research papers by teacher and researcher Cyril Grunspan (Da Vinci Research Center) 
and Ricardo Perez-Marco : *https://github.com/lth-elm/cryptofinance/tree/main/papers*

The understanding of this paper and its visual presentation in this website was conducted by Laith El Mershati, student of the **Enginnering School De Vinci Paris** (ESILV), and is part of a school project.
